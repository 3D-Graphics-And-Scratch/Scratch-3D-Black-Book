# Running Scratch code
*scratchtomv*

3D projects run really slow on vanilla Scratch, as it uses a JavaScript virtual machine to run the code block by block. 
Hopefully a Scratch fork called [Turbowarp](https://turbowarp.org/) allows projects to run blazingly fast by compiling them to JavaScript. It was created by [GarboMuffin](https://scratch.mit.edu/users/GarboMuffin/) and is nowadays vastly used by the Scratch community.
