# Glossary

#### AABB : {.aabb} 
Axis-Aligned Bounding Box (AABB) - A Bounding box aligned with the axes of the coordinate system.

#### Buffer : {.buffer} 
A section of memory used for temporary data storage.

#### BVH : {.bvh} 
Bounding Volume Hierarchy (BVH) - An acceleration structure made of primitive 3D objects that speeds up ray-casting and various algorithms.

#### Camera Space : {.camera-space} 
*(also known as; View Space, Eye Space)* - 3D information of 3D coordinates projected relative to the camera. Includes relative depth.

#### Depth Buffer : {.depth-buffer} 
An additional screen-space buffer that provides depth information.

#### DOF : {.dof} 
Depth of Field (DOF) - The distance between the nearest and the furthest objects that are in acceptably sharp focus in an image captured with a camera.

#### Epsilon : {.epsilon} 
A very small value, mostly used to prevent floating point inaccuracies and to set raymarching limits.

#### Focal length : {.focal-length} 
A camera property that indicates how strongly it converges or diverges light. Inversely proportional to the FOV.

#### FOV : {.fov} 
Field of View (FOV) - The angular extent of the world that is seen. Inversely proportional to the focal length.

#### Magnitude : {.magnitude} 
The length of a vector.

#### Mesh : {.mesh} 
A collection of faces, edges, and vertices that define the object's shape.

#### Model Space : {.model-space} 
*(also known as; Object Space, Local Space)* - 3D coordinates relative to another point of reference, typically used to store meshes of individual models/objects.

#### Normal : {.normal} 
A vector perpendicular to the surface of an object.

#### Pen : {.pen} 
A vanilla Scratch extension used to draw on the screen.

#### Procedural : {.procedural} 
Defined by code.

#### Rasterizer : {.rasterizer} 
An algorithm that draws objects to the screen by filling in shapes pixel-by-pixel.

#### Ray : {.ray} 
Defined by its origin (a position in 3D space where the ray starts) and its direction (a vector parallel to the direction of the ray).

#### Screen Space : {.screen-space} 
*(also known as; Clip Space)* - 2D information of 3D coordinates projected to the screen. Does not include depth information.

#### SDF : {.sdf} 
Signed Distance Field (SDF) - A function defining distance to the surface of an object with interior points being negative, and exterior being positive.

#### Vector : {.vector} 
An object having direction as well as magnitude, especially as determining the position of one point in space relative to another.

#### Vertex : {.vertex} 
A point with a coordinate vector.

#### Viewing Frustum : {.viewing-frustum} 
The region of space in the modeled world that may appear on the screen.

#### World Space : {.world-space} 
3D coordinates relative to the center of the world, typically (0, 0, 0).
