# Handling colors in Scratch
*scratchtomv*  

In 3D computing, colors are often represented as a set of 3 values: Red, Green and Blue. Thereâ€™s sometimes also a fourth one: Alpha (abbreviated as A), often used for transparency.  
When rendering a 3D scene, these values can be easily modified to change the final color of the object. This is done through setting a [Material](../shading/shading.md#material) color, [Shading](../shading/shading.md) and [Post-processing](./post-processing.md).
