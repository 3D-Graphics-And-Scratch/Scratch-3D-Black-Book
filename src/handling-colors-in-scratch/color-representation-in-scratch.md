# Color representation in Scratch
*scratchtomv*  

Scratch doesnâ€™t natively support RGB colors, you need to convert to a supported color format, such as : 

* Hexadecimal (ex: \#FF2D55)  
* Decimal (ex: 16711680\)

The pen color can be set with this block :

Or with the combination of these blocks (uses the HSVA model, and is slower) :
