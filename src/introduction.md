# Scratch 3D Project Development  
*By the [3D Graphics and Scratch Group](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/32030084/).*

This Book, created by 3D Graphics and Scratch (3DGaS), is intended as a comprehensive guide to modern 3d Scratch graphics programming. The book starts from simple concepts before branching to a variety of higher level concepts. Beginners are advised not to skip sections to avoid missing crucial foundational information. 

>For those with a general understanding of fundamental concepts like pre-calculus, geometry, optimization, and best practices, it is possible to jump directly to [Rasterization and Triangles](./rasterization-and-triangles/rasterization-and-triangles.md). The book also includes a [Glossary](./glossary.md) for definitions of common vocabulary, a valuable resource for both novices and experienced programmers.
