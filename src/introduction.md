# Scratch 3D Project Development  
*By the 3D Graphics and Scratch Group.*

This book is intended as a guide to modern Scratch graphics programming. There may be things mentioned but not covered in detail.
Creating 3D games or applications on Scratch might seem intimidating at first, but with this handy book you will be able to create simple to advanced 3D projects on Scratch.   
We recommend beginners to read the book in the correct order to not miss crucial information.   

>If you’re an experienced scratcher, you can already skip to [Rasterization and Triangles](./rasterization-and-triangles/rasterization-and-triangles.md). For vocabulary help take a look at [Glossary](./glossary.md).
